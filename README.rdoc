= Olag

Olag - Oren's Library/Application Gem framework

== TL;DR

=== Description

Olag is Oren's set of utilities for creating a well-behaved gem. This is very
opinionated code; it eliminates a lot of the boilerplate, at the cost of making
many decisions which may not be suitable for everyone (directory structure,
code verification, Codnar for documentation, etc.).

=== Installation

A simple <tt>gem install olag</tt> should do the trick, assuming you have
Ruby gems set up.
